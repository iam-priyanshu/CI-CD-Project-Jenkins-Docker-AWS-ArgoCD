# Spring Boot Based Java Web Application

This is a simple Spring Boot-based Java application that can be built using Maven. Spring Boot dependencies are handled using the `pom.xml` at the root directory of the repository.

This is an MVC architecture-based application where the controller returns a page with title and message attributes to the view.
